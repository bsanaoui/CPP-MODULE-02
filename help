* Floating Point Numbers:
    - significant digit (number of digit in a number)
    - std:fixed to print all significant
    - float = 6 trust digit  = FLT_DIG ;
    - double = 15 trust digit = DBL_DIG ;
    - long double = 18 ***** = LDBL_DIG ; more presision

* fraction :  Numerator / denominator
    - Numerator 
    - denominator
